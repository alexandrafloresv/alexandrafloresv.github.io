    "text": "I am an Environmental Engineer from Trujillo, Perú with experience in environmental management, GIS and spatial analysis.\nMy professional experience spans environmental consulting, where I have worked on environmental impact assessment and environmental monitoring across agriculture, production, and energy sectors. I have also worked extensively in municipal and industrial solid waste management.\nBeyond consulting, I’ve participated in biological monitoring fieldwork in the Tambopata National Reserve (Madre de Dios, Peru), where I gained hands-on experience with wildlife monitoring methodologies.I’ve also collaborated with conservation organizations like FUNDA (Colombia) on managing vegetation databases and remote vegetation mapping the páramo ecosystem using GIS.\nBeyond technical work, I have experience in education, environmental communication and graphic design through volunteer work with NGOs, where I created visual content to support diverse initiatives in my community.\n\nCurrent focus\nI am particularly interested in monitoring forests, land-use change, and the usage of spatial data and tools for conservation.\nCurrently, I am continuing to strengthen my skills in spatial modeling and remote sensing, with a particular interest in:\n\nForest monitoring.\nLand-use change detection.\nDeveloping reproducible workflows in R for spatial analysis.\nRemote sensing aplications for environmental management.\n\nThis website will showcase projects I develop as part of my learning journey.\n\n\nContact\nEmail: mlfloresv@unitru.edu.pe",
