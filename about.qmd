I am an Environmental Engineer focused on spatial analysis and remote sensing.

My work includes spatial data analysis and developing reproducible workflows in R to support ecological interpretation and decision-making.

I an particularly interested in monitoring forests, land-use change, and the usage of spatial data and tools for conservation.

Currently, I am continuing to strengthen my technical skills in spatial modeling and remote sensing, and in this is a site I will be showcasing projects I make as part of my learning.
